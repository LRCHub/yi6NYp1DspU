The sun is shining and I'm wide awake
I turn off my six alarms and open up the curtains
All my friends think my contentment must be fake
I just keep on smiling so I can assure them
I make my way into the kitchen now
I prepare my coffee with a healthy dose of creamer
Everyone around me often wonders how
After all this time why am I still a dreamer
My morning routine
Get up, get dressed, and pray for my life to begin
Each day is like the start of every movie еver made
I patiently еxpect success to come my way
Good things will always come to those who wait
Listen up, listen up
Come on, everybody, focus
We'll be fine if we use coordination
Listen up, listen up (Keep it steady)
Come on, everybody, focus (Keep it steady)
We'll be fine if we use coordination (Keep it steady)
Listen up, listen up (Keep it steady)
Come on, everybody, focus (Keep it steady)
We'll be fine if we use coordination (Keep it steady)
My morning routine
Get up, get dressed, and pray for my life to begin
Each day is like the start of every movie ever made
I patiently expect (Patiently)
Success to come my way (Expect success)
Good things will always come to those who wait
Oh
